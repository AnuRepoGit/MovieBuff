**Project Overview**

Welcome to the Movie Buff App! This project was developed to showcase my skills and approach to building web applications. The app allows users to search for movies, filter results by genre, and navigate through paginated search results. It utilizes the public Movies API 
and the implementation was done using both Rest Api and Graphql

**Highlights**

One of the most interesting and significant aspects of this project is the implementation of the genre filtering feature. This feature required careful handling of API requests to ensure that the filter options were dynamically populated based on the available genres. The logic for updating the movie list based on selected genres was also a key challenge, ensuring that users receive accurate and relevant search results without unnecessary API calls with proper pagination being handled for the ease of user.


**Pride Points**

I am most pleased with the overall user experience and interface design of the application. Despite the time constraints, I managed to create a clean, intuitive, and responsive design that ensures a smooth user experience. The layout is simple yet effective, making it easy for users to search for movies, navigate through results, and view detailed information about each movie.

During the development of this project, I was able to quickly grasp the GraphQL structure and schema, test it thoroughly in Postman, and implement it effectively within the application. To maintain a lightweight and efficient codebase, I utilized React hooks, particularly useContext, ensuring efficient state management and optimal use of React concepts.

**GraphQL Schema and Structure**
The GraphQL schema was designed to align with the application's data requirements, providing a clear and efficient structure for querying and mutating data. This allowed for seamless integration with the front end and ensured that the application could leverage the full power of GraphQL.

**Future Improvements**

Given more time, the next features or improvements I would like to add to the project would be:

**Advanced Search Options**: Implementing refined search capabilities by rating and summary will allow users to filter their movie searches more precisely, enhancing the overall search experience.

**Enhanced UI Design**: Upgrading the user interface to a more polished and professional design will provide a more engaging and aesthetically pleasing experience for users, making the application feel modern and intuitive.

**Optimized API Calls and Caching**: Improving the efficiency of API calls and implementing caching mechanisms will reduce load times and increase the responsiveness of the application, resulting in a smoother and faster user experience.

**State Management Framework**: Although the current simple features did not necessitate a state management framework, introducing one will prepare the application for future scalability and maintainability, ensuring it can handle more complex features and interactions seamlessly.
